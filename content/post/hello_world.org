some wip notes on ideas for a new i3 rice.

* colors
same background, but in different color themes, cycling based on time of day or day of the week.

better support for multiple color themes

* binds
right now there's a lot of needing to remember random keys for binds; for example, there are 3 different Rofi binds.
instead, maybe I want to add a Rofi-mode instead and then allow keyboard arpeggios to choose the next action so there are more keys.
for example, with the password-select, use ~Super+Shift+P~ to open *Password* mode and then ~Enter~ for password input or ~u~ for username input.
this gives us a more modal UI that clogs up less of the keyboard shortcuts.
* tweaking
+ add instructions to sync xresources colors to kitty
