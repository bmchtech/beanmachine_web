# hi there

welcome to this little blog! sometimes i post notes on various tech-related things.

a lot of this blog is organized in an unstructured way: the posts are more in a format of notes than coherent blog posts.
i find that it's a format that lets me write information concisely.
furthermore, the the notes double as my own notebook and as blog posts here.

i hope some of the information can be useful to someone out there!
